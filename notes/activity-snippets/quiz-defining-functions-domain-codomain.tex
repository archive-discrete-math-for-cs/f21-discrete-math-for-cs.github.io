Recall the function
$d_0$ which takes an ordered pair of ratings $3$-tuples and returns a measure
of the distance between them 
given by
\[
d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, y_3) ~) ~) = \sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2}
\]
Consider the function application 
\[
  d_0 (~( ~(-1,1,1), (1, 0, -1)~) ~)
\]

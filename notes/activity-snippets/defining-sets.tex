{\it To define sets:}

To define a set using {\bf roster method}, explicitly list its elements. That is,
start with $\{$ then list elements of 
the set separated by commas and close with $\}$.

To define a set using {\bf set builder definition}, either form 
``The set of all $x$ from the universe $U$ such that $x$ is ..." by writing
\[\{x \in U \mid ...x... \}\]
or form ``the collection of all outputs of some operation when the input ranges over the universe $U$"
by writing
\[\{ ...x... \mid x\in U \}\]

We use the symbol $\in$ as ``is an element of'' to indicate membership in a set.\\


{\bf Example sets}: For each of the following, identify whether it's defined using the roster method
or set builder notation and give an example element.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[]$\{ -1, 1\}$\\
    \item[]$\{0, 0 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{-1, 0, 1 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{(x,x,x) \mid x \in \{-1,0,1\} \}$\\
    \item[]$\{ \}$\\
    \item[]$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \geq 0 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z}  \mid x > 0 \}$\\
    \item[]$\{\A,\C,\U,\G\}$ \\
    \item[]$\{\A\U\G, \U\A\G, \U\G\A, \U\A\A \}$\\
\end{itemize}

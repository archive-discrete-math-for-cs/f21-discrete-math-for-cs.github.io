{\it Recall the definition of base expansion we discussed:}

\input{../activity-snippets/base-expansion-definition.tex}

We write an algorithm for converting from base $b_1$ expansion to base $b_2$ expansion:

\phantom{
Earlier, we saw (two different) algorithms for, given 
a target base $b$, converting from decimal to base $b$ expansions. 
We will use either one of these as a subroutine in this algorithm.\\
Given a base expansion in base $b_1$:\\
Step 1: Use the definition of base expansion to calculate the value of
    this number (in decimal).\\
Step 2: Use the Least Significant First algorithm to write this value in 
    base $b_2$ and output the result.

{\bf Integer division and remainders} (aka The Division Algorithm) Let $n$ be an integer 
and $d$ a positive integer. There are unique integers $q$ and $r$, with $0 \leq r < d$, such that 
$n = dq + r$. In this case, $d$ is called the divisor, $n$ is called the dividend, 
$q$ is called the quotient, 
and $r$ is called the remainder. We write $q=n \textbf{ div } d$ and $r=n \textbf{ mod } d$.

\textit{Extra example}: How do $\textbf{ div }$ and $\textbf{ mod }$ compare to $/$ and $\%$ in Java and python?
